# KLSE Stock Quote API
This is a simple program to scrape the data for a given stock symbol or number and return some basic values. Applications include tracking your portfolio in excel or interfacing with a trading bot.

## Endpoints
Stock quotes can be retrieved either by the tickers symbol or number.

__eg.: Quote for Maybank__
Using ticker symbol ```/s/[symbol]```
```
GET http://localhost:3000/s/maybank
```
or using the ticker's number, ```/id/[number]```
```
GET http://localhost:3000/id/1155
```

Yields
```json
