# KLSE Stock Quote API
This is a simple program to scrape the data for a given stock symbol or number and return some basic values. Applications include tracking your portfolio in excel or interfacing with a trading bot.

## 🚀 Running locally
This program only requires NodeJS and NPM to be installed. A local instance can then be run with the following commands
```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

### 📝 Notes
* The stock data is scraped from i3investor.com and is intended for personal use only. I do not own the data and am not responsible for how you use the program.
* The price quoted is not realtime and is usually delayed by 15 minutes.
